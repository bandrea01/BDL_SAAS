        <p>In this viewer you can move in two ways:</p>
        <p>
            • While holding <strong>LEFT</strong> click you can rotate the scene.
        </p>
        <p>
            • While holding <strong>RIGHT</strong> click you can move through the
            axes.
        </p>
        <p>
            • Double-clicking the <strong>SCROLL WHEEL</strong> initiates a length
            measurement operation, which you can conclude simply by
            double-clicking it again. If you want to delete a previous
            measurament, you can simply point at it and press
            <strong>DELETE</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            In the toolbar on the bottom you can perform three different actions:
        </p>
        <p>
            • <strong>Load IFC:</strong> you can load a IFC file that you want to
            visualize.
        </p>
        <p>
            • <strong>Models</strong>: you can handle objects in the scene, by
            deleting them singularly.
        </p>
        <p>
            • <strong>Properties</strong>: if you click on a fragment of the
            loaded 3D model you can check all its properties in this window.
